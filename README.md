🎮 Fitgirl---Fuckingfast-downloader-script 🚀
I was downloading Call of Duty: World War 2 🕹️ and, when I tried using torrents, it was taking days to finish ⏳. Frustrated with the slow download speeds, I turned to fuckingfast links ⚡, which were incredibly fast. However, there was a catch—there were lots of links to download, and doing it manually was a huge hassle 😩.

That's when I decided to create this script 💡.

This script automates the entire process, saving you time ⏰ and effort 💪. It handles multiple download links, clicks the "DOWNLOAD" button 🖱️, and checks if the download page is valid ✅. Unlike torrents, which are often slow and unreliable 🐢, fuckingfast links provide lightning-fast speeds ⚡, and this script helps you take full advantage of that 🚀.

Now, instead of manually managing dozens of links 🔗, this script does it for you, making downloading from fuckingfast a breeze 🌬️!

Prerequisites 🛠️

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

1) Python 3.x 🐍
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official Python website.

2) Selenium Library 📚
This script requires the Selenium Python library to interact with the browser. You can install it by running the following command in an elevated command prompt (run as admin):

```bash ... 
pip install selenium
```
3) Google Chrome 🌐
The script uses Google Chrome. Ensure that it is installed on your system. If you don’t have it, download it from the official Google Chrome website.

4) ChromeDriver 🖥️
You need to download the correct version of ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version. You can find the right version of ChromeDriver here. Place chromedriver.exe in the same directory as the script.
```bash ... 
https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable
```
